## Overview

This project implements a simplified version of the classic card game Blackjack. The game is played between the player and the dealer, with the objective of getting as close to 21 points as possible without exceeding it.

## My process

### What I learned

1. JavaScript Basics: This project involves fundamental JavaScript concepts such as variables, functions, loops, conditional statements, and event handling.

2. DOM Manipulation: The code interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the HTML content based on game events and user interactions.

3. Algorithmic Thinking: The project requires implementing game logic, including card value calculation, handling Aces, determining winners, and managing game flow.

### Continued development

For future development, consider implementing the code in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Utilize constructor functions or ES6 classes for object initialization to enhance organization and readability. Employ inheritance and polymorphism to build class hierarchies, enabling reuse of functionalities and enhancing modularity. Separate game logic from interface interactions by encapsulating DOM manipulation and event handling, thus improving maintainability. Ensure a stronger, more reliable codebase by implementing error handling and thorough unit testing during refactoring.
