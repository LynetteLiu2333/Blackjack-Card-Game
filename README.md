## My process

### What I Learned

- **JavaScript Fundamentals:** I deepened my knowledge of core JavaScript concepts such as creating and invoking functions to encapsulate game logic, using loops for iterating over the card deck and player hands, and applying conditional statements to manage game decisions. Additionally, I practiced setting up event listeners to handle user interactions, like dealing cards and starting new games.

- **DOM Manipulation:** The project required extensive interaction with the Document Object Model (DOM). I learned how to select HTML elements using methods like `document.getElementById` and `querySelector`, and dynamically update their content with `innerHTML` and `textContent` to reflect the current game state.

- **Algorithmic Thinking:** I developed and refined algorithms to handle game logic including calculating the value of a player's hand with special handling for Aces (worth 1 or 11 points), managing the sequence of game events such as dealing cards, checking for busts, and determining winners. I also implemented randomization techniques to shuffle the deck and ensure fair card distribution, enhancing the game's unpredictability and realism.
