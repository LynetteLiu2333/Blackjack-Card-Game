## Overview

This project implements a simplified version of the classic card game Blackjack. The game is played between the player and the dealer, with the objective of getting as close to 21 points as possible without exceeding it.

### Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

### What I learned

1. JavaScript Basics: This project involves fundamental JavaScript concepts such as variables, functions, loops, conditional statements, and event handling. It demonstrates how these elements are used to create interactive web applications.

2. DOM Manipulation: The code interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the HTML content based on game events and user interactions. Understanding DOM manipulation is crucial for building interactive web interfaces.

3. Algorithmic Thinking: The project requires implementing game logic, including card value calculation, handling Aces, determining winners, and managing game flow. This fosters algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills.

### Continued development

To elevate the code to a more advanced level, transitioning to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles is key. This entails restructuring the code into classes, each encapsulating related functionality and data attributes. By employing constructor functions or ES6 class syntax, objects can be initialized with properties and methods, promoting better organization and readability. Leveraging inheritance and polymorphism allows for a hierarchy of classes, enabling reuse of common functionalities and promoting modularity. Encapsulation of DOM manipulation and event handling separate the game logic from interface interactions, enhancing code maintainability. With error handling mechanisms in place and thorough unit testing, the refactored codebase will offer a more robust foundation, facilitating future enhancements and expansions with ease.
