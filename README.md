## My process

### What I learned

1. JavaScript Basics: This project involves fundamental JavaScript concepts such as variables, functions, loops, conditional statements, and event handling.

2. DOM Manipulation: The code interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the HTML content based on game events and user interactions.

3. Algorithmic Thinking: The project requires implementing game logic, including card value calculation, handling Aces, determining winners, and managing game flow.
